    <h1>Duques Hall Study Room Policies</h1>
    <p>A GWorld card enabled for campus access is required for entrance to Duques Hall.<br>

        Access to the reservation software is only available using an @gwu.edu account. <br>
        
        Rooms are available for reservation on a first come, first served basis.<br>
        Reservations may be placed up to two weeks in advance.<br>
        A student may place up to 2 hours of reservations each day.<br>
        When not reserved, an open study room may be used by one or more people for study. If someone arrives with a reservation, the room must be vacated for their use immediately. <br>
        Windows may not be covered for any reason. Anyone found inside a study room with the windows covered may be banned from future room reservations. </p>
